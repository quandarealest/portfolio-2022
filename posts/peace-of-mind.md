[Peace of Mind](https://peaceofmindtbay.herokuapp.com) is a Progressive Web Application to bridge the communication gap between elders in caregiving homes and their families. The caregiver will be responsible for updating the application with the status of each activity allocated to that elder. Both the communication between caregivers and immediate families and the eldersâ€™ actives will be react-time updated.

- **Progressive Web App** is used for cross platform purpose. Both users and caregivers can install the application to mobiles through the website.
- **Socket.IO** is used for the internal chat function between day cares' managers and family members. **JSON Web Token** is also used for authentication purpose for login, logout.

Peace of Mind also acts as a CSM tool for the supervisor to assign/manage caregivers and residents living in the day cares, but this feature will come in phase 2 of the application. [Project's source code.](https://github.com/quandarealest/PeaceofMind)
